3.  **Using Profiles (Recommended for multiple accounts/roles):**
    You can set up multiple named profiles to easily switch between different AWS accounts or IAM roles:

    ```bash
    aws configure --profile my-dev-account
    # Follow prompts for my-dev-account credentials
    ```

    Then, specify the profile when running commands:

    ```bash
    aws s3 ls --profile my-dev-account
    ```

#### Basic Command Structure

The AWS CLI commands follow a consistent structure:

`aws <service> <command> <subcommand> [options]`

  * `<service>`: The AWS service you want to interact with (e.g., `s3`, `ec2`, `iam`, `lambda`).
  * `<command>`: The action you want to perform on that service (e.g., `ls`, `describe-instances`, `list-users`).
  * `<subcommand>`: Some commands have further sub-actions.
  * `[options]`: Additional parameters to refine your command (e.g., `--bucket`, `--instance-ids`, `--query`).

#### Practical Examples: Common AWS CLI Commands ‚úÖ

Here are some common operations you can perform with the AWS CLI:

  * **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**

      * List all your S3 buckets:
        ```bash
        aws s3 ls
        ```
      * Copy a local file to an S3 bucket:
        ```bash
        aws s3 cp my-local-file.txt s3://my-unique-bucket-name/my-cloud-file.txt
        ```
      * Sync a local directory with an S3 bucket (great for static website deployments):
        ```bash
        aws s3 sync ./my-local-website-folder/ s3://my-static-website-bucket/ --delete
        ```

  * **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**

      * List all running EC2 instances:
        ```bash
        aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running"
        ```
      * Start a specific EC2 instance:
        ```bash
        aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-0abcdef1234567890
        ```
      * Stop a specific EC2 instance:
        ```bash
        aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0abcdef1234567890
        ```

  * **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):**

      * List all IAM users in your account:
        ```bash
        aws iam list-users
        ```

  * **Amazon CloudWatch Logs:**

      * List all log groups:
        ```bash
        aws logs describe-log-groups
        ```

-----

#### Output Formats

You can control the output format of CLI commands using the `--output` flag or by setting a default in `aws configure`:

  * `json` (default for `aws configure`): Ideal for scripting and programmatic parsing.
    ```bash
    aws s3 ls --output json
    ```
  * `text`: Simple text output, space-delimited, often used for simple grepping.
    ```bash
    aws s3 ls --output text
    ```
  * `table`: Human-readable ASCII table format.
    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --output table
    ```

#### Best Practices for AWS CLI Usage üí°

  * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Always use IAM users or roles with the minimum necessary permissions required for the tasks you're performing. Never use root account credentials for CLI access.
  * **Use Profiles:** Organize your credentials and configurations using named profiles, especially if you work with multiple AWS accounts or roles.
  * **Leverage `--query` (JMESPath):** For advanced filtering and transforming complex JSON output, learn to use the powerful `--query` option with JMESPath expressions.
  * **Automate with Scripts:** Write shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks. This ensures consistency and saves time.
  * **Error Handling:** In scripts, always check the exit code of AWS CLI commands (`$?` in bash) to handle errors gracefully.
  * **Refer to Documentation & Help:** Use `aws help` to see a list of top-level commands, and `aws <service> help` or `aws <service> <command> help` for detailed information on specific services and commands.
  * **Environment Variables for Temporary Credentials:** For CI/CD or temporary access, use environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) for programmatic authentication, rather than storing static credentials.
