    AWS Secret Access Key [****************wJgJ]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
    Default region name [None]: us-east-1
    Default output format [None]: json
    ```

3.  **Using Profiles (Recommended for multiple accounts/roles):**
    You can set up multiple named profiles to easily switch between different AWS accounts or IAM roles:

    ```bash
    aws configure --profile my-dev-account
    # Follow prompts for my-dev-account credentials
    ```

    Then, specify the profile when running commands:

    ```bash
    aws s3 ls --profile my-dev-account
    ```

-----

#### Basic Command Structure

The AWS CLI commands follow a consistent structure:

`aws <service> <command> <subcommand> [options]`

  * `<service>`: The AWS service you want to interact with (e.g., `s3`, `ec2`, `iam`, `lambda`).
  * `<command>`: The action you want to perform on that service (e.g., `ls`, `describe-instances`, `list-users`).
  * `<subcommand>`: Some commands have further sub-actions.
  * `[options]`: Additional parameters to refine your command (e.g., `--bucket`, `--instance-ids`, `--query`).

-----

#### Practical Examples: Common AWS CLI Commands ‚úÖ

Here are some common operations you can perform with the AWS CLI:

  * **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**

      * List all your S3 buckets:
        ```bash
        aws s3 ls
        ```
      * Copy a local file to an S3 bucket:
        ```bash
        aws s3 cp my-local-file.txt s3://my-unique-bucket-name/my-cloud-file.txt
        ```
      * Sync a local directory with an S3 bucket (great for static website deployments):
        ```bash
        aws s3 sync ./my-local-website-folder/ s3://my-static-website-bucket/ --delete
        ```

  * **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**

      * List all running EC2 instances:
        ```bash
        aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running"
        ```
      * Start a specific EC2 instance:
        ```bash
        aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-0abcdef1234567890
        ```
      * Stop a specific EC2 instance:
        ```bash
        aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0abcdef1234567890
        ```

  * **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):**

      * List all IAM users in your account:
        ```bash
        aws iam list-users
        ```

  * **Amazon CloudWatch Logs:**

      * List all log groups:
        ```bash
        aws logs describe-log-groups
        ```

-----

#### Output Formats

You can control the output format of CLI commands using the `--output` flag or by setting a default in `aws configure`:

  * `json` (default for `aws configure`): Ideal for scripting and programmatic parsing.
    ```bash
    aws s3 ls --output json
    ```
  * `text`: Simple text output, space-delimited, often used for simple grepping.
    ```bash
    aws s3 ls --output text
    ```
  * `table`: Human-readable ASCII table format.
    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --output table
    ```

-----

#### Best Practices for AWS CLI Usage üí°

  * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Always use IAM users or roles with the minimum necessary permissions required for the tasks you're performing. Never use root account credentials for CLI access.
  * **Use Profiles:** Organize your credentials and configurations using named profiles, especially if you work with multiple AWS accounts or roles.
  * **Leverage `--query` (JMESPath):** For advanced filtering and transforming complex JSON output, learn to use the powerful `--query` option with JMESPath expressions.
  * **Automate with Scripts:** Write shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks. This ensures consistency and saves time.
  * **Error Handling:** In scripts, always check the exit code of AWS CLI commands (`$?` in bash) to handle errors gracefully.
  * **Refer to Documentation & Help:** Use `aws help` to see a list of top-level commands, and `aws <service> help` or `aws <service> <command> help` for detailed information on specific services and commands.
  * **Environment Variables for Temporary Credentials:** For CI/CD or temporary access, use environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) for programmatic authentication, rather than storing static credentials.

### Managing AWS Services with the AWS CLI: A Practical Guide üõ†Ô∏è

Building on your knowledge of what the AWS CLI is and how to configure it, this guide will dive into practical, service-specific examples for managing your AWS resources directly from the command line. This is the bridge that transitions you from clicking in the web console to writing repeatable, auditable scripts that automate your cloud infrastructure.

By exploring common operations for key services like S3, EC2, Lambda, and IAM, you'll gain the confidence to manage and automate your AWS environment with unparalleled efficiency.

-----

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

  * **AWS CLI v2 Installed:** Refer to the "AWS CLI" README for installation instructions.
  * **A Configured AWS Profile:** Run `aws configure` to set up your credentials and default region.

-----

#### Practical Management Examples by Service

##### 1\. Amazon S3: Object Storage Management üì¶

S3 is the perfect starting point for CLI management due to its straightforward command structure (`aws s3` vs `aws s3api`).

  * **List Your Buckets:**

    ```bash
    aws s3 ls
    ```

  * **Create a New Bucket:**

      * **Note:** Bucket names must be globally unique.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-unique-cli-bucket-2025 --region us-east-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-east-1
    ```

      * This uses the lower-level `s3api` command, which provides more options than the simpler `aws s3`.

  * **Copy Files to a Bucket:**

      * The `s3 cp` command is a powerful tool for transferring files.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Copy a local file to S3
    aws s3 cp local-file.txt s3://my-unique-cli-bucket-2025/folder/

    # Copy an S3 object to your local machine
    aws s3 cp s3://my-unique-cli-bucket-2025/folder/local-file.txt .
    ```

  * **Sync a Local Directory with a Bucket:**

      * The `s3 sync` command is a favorite for automating backups or deploying static websites.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    aws s3 sync ./my-local-website-folder/ s3://my-unique-cli-bucket-2025/ --delete
    ```

      * The `--delete` flag removes files from S3 that are no longer in the local directory, ensuring a true synchronization.

  * **Delete a Bucket:**

    ```bash
    # Note: The bucket must be empty.
    # Use the --force flag to delete a bucket and all its objects.
    aws s3 rb s3://my-unique-cli-bucket-2025 --force
    ```

##### 2\. Amazon EC2: Virtual Server Control üíª

The CLI gives you granular control over your EC2 instances without touching the console.

  * **Launch a New EC2 Instance:**

      * This is a complex command, but shows the power of the CLI to define every parameter.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-013146447814a0149 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name my-ssh-key --security-group-ids sg-abcdef1234567890
    ```

      * You can capture the output and save the new instance ID for later use in scripts.

  * **List and Filter Instances:**

      * This is a common task. You can filter by state, tags, and more.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Get details for all instances in a 'running' state
    aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running"

    # Get only the Instance ID and Public IP of running instances
    aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,PublicIpAddress]' --output text
    ```

  * **Start, Stop, and Terminate Instances:**

    ```bash
    # Stop a specific instance
    aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0abcdef1234567890

    # Start a specific instance
    aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-0abcdef1234567890

    # Terminate an instance (DANGEROUS! Be careful!)
    aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-0abcdef1234567890
    ```

##### 3\. AWS Lambda: Serverless Function Operations üöÄ

The CLI is perfect for managing the full lifecycle of your serverless functions, including deployment.

  * **Create a New Lambda Function:**

      * This example assumes you have a zip file of your function code.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    aws lambda create-function \
        --function-name MyCLIFunction \
        --runtime nodejs20.x \
        --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-ex \
        --handler index.handler \
        --zip-file fileb://function.zip
    ```

  * **Invoke a Function:**

      * Use the `--payload` flag to send a JSON payload to your function.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    aws lambda invoke --function-name MyCLIFunction --payload '{"key": "value"}' output.json
    ```

  * **Update Function Code:**

    ```bash
    aws lambda update-function-code --function-name MyCLIFunction --zip-file fileb://updated_function.zip
    ```

##### 4\. AWS IAM: Security & Access Management üîë

Managing users, roles, and policies is a core security task that can be scripted with the CLI.

  * **Create a New IAM User:**

    ```bash
    aws iam create-user --user-name my-cli-user
    ```

  * **Attach a Policy to a User:**

      * This attaches the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy, a good practice for demonstrating the principle of least privilege.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name my-cli-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
    ```

-----

#### Advanced AWS CLI Techniques for Automation

To truly master the CLI for management, go beyond basic commands.

  * **Filtering with `--query` (JMESPath):**

      * This is the most powerful CLI feature for handling complex JSON output.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # List Instance IDs and Public IPs of all 'running' instances in a nice table
    aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].{ID:InstanceId,PublicIP:PublicIpAddress}' --output table
    ```

      * **Tip:** Use `jq` (a command-line JSON processor) for even more advanced parsing and manipulation of CLI output.

  * **Using a JSON File for Complex Input:**

      * For commands with complex JSON parameters (like bucket policies), it's cleaner to write the JSON in a file and reference it.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # --- file: policy.json ---
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-unique-cli-bucket-2025/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    # Command to apply the policy
    aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket my-unique-cli-bucket-2025 --policy file://policy.json
    ```

  * **Handling Pagination:**

      * By default, the CLI returns a certain number of results per page. You can override this.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Get all results without pagination
    aws s3 ls --no-paginate

    # Get 100 results at a time
    aws s3 ls --page-size 100
    ```

-----

#### Best Practices for CLI-based Management üí°

  * **Start with `--dry-run`:** For commands that modify resources (like `ec2 run-instances`), use the `--dry-run` flag to validate the syntax and permissions without actually performing the action.
  * **Use `aws help` frequently:** It's your best friend. Use `aws <service> help` and `aws <service> <command> help` to explore options.
  * **Redirect Output:** Send command output to files (`aws s3 ls > buckets.txt`) for logging or later analysis.
  * **Test in Non-Production:** Always test your scripts and complex commands in a development or staging environment before running them in production.
  * **Secure Your Scripts:** Never hardcode credentials in your scripts. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or profiles.
  * **Pipe to `jq`:** For scripting, piping the CLI's JSON output to `jq` is a standard and powerful practice for parsing and filtering.
    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-instances | jq '.Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress'
    ```

-----

By embracing the AWS CLI, you transition from a reactive cloud administrator to a proactive cloud engineer. You can build scripts that provision entire application stacks, manage resources with surgical precision, and create repeatable, auditable infrastructure-as-code workflows.

# Assignment 72: Publishing HTML Reports in CI/CD üöÄ

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step solution for publishing interactive HTML test reports (e.g., generated by your E2E tests, coverage tools, or other custom reports) within your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

Unlike JUnit XML reports, which are parsed for summary statistics, HTML reports offer rich, detailed, and often interactive views of your test runs, code coverage, or custom metrics. Making them available directly from your CI/CD platform greatly enhances debugging and analysis.

-----

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

  * **HTML Report Generation:** Your testing framework or build process is configured to **generate HTML output files**. This is crucial, as CI/CD tools primarily function by archiving these files.
      * **Example (Cypress with `mochawesome` for HTML reports):**
        ```javascript
        // cypress.config.js
        const { defineConfig } = require('cypress');

        module.exports = defineConfig({
          e2e: {
            setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
              // implement node event listeners here
            },
            specPattern: 'cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
            // Configure Mochawesome for HTML reports
            reporter: 'mochawesome',
            reporterOptions: {
              reportDir: 'cypress/reports/mochawesome', // Directory for HTML reports
              overwrite: false,
              html: true, // Generate HTML report
              json: true, // Also generate JSON for potential further processing
              charts: true,
              timestamp: 'mmddyyyy_HHMMss', // Unique timestamp for report names
            },
          },
        });
        ```
      * **Example (Playwright with default HTML reporter):**
        ```javascript
        // playwright.config.ts
        import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

        export default defineConfig({
          // ...
          reporter: 'html', // Playwright's built-in HTML reporter
          outputDir: 'playwright-report/', // Default output directory
          // ...
        });
        ```
  * **An Active CI/CD Pipeline:** You have an existing CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, CircleCI) where your tests are executed.

-----

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Confirm HTML Report Generation ‚úÖ

Verify that your tests are indeed producing the desired HTML files.

  * **Action:** Run your tests locally.
  * **Verification:** After the test run, check the specified output directory (e.g., `cypress/reports/mochawesome`, `playwright-report/`) for `.html` files. These are the reports we aim to publish.

#### Step 2: Integrate Test Execution into Your CI/CD Pipeline ‚öôÔ∏è

Your pipeline needs a step that runs your tests and thus generates the HTML reports.

  * **Action:** Locate the appropriate stage or job in your CI/CD pipeline configuration. Add a command to execute your tests.
  * **Example (Node.js project running Cypress):**
    ```yaml
    # In your CI/CD config file (e.g., .gitlab-ci.yml, .github/workflows/main.yml)
    # ...
    scripts:
      - npm install # Install dependencies
      - npm run cypress:run # Execute E2E tests which generate HTML reports
    # ...
    ```

#### Step 3: Archive HTML Reports as Pipeline Artifacts üì¶

This is the most critical step for publishing HTML reports. Since CI/CD tools generally don't "display" HTML directly in their UI like JUnit, we make them accessible by archiving them as artifacts.

  * **Action:** Configure your CI/CD pipeline step to store the generated HTML files (and any related assets like CSS/JS) as build artifacts.

  * **Path:** Specify the exact directory and/or file pattern where your HTML reports (and their supporting files/folders) are generated. It's often best to archive the entire report directory.

  * **Example CI/CD Configurations:**

      * **Jenkins (Pipeline Script - `Jenkinsfile`):**

        ```groovy
        stage('Archive HTML Report') {
            steps {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'cypress/reports/mochawesome/**/*.html,cypress/reports/mochawesome/assets/**/*' // Adjust paths
            }
        }
        ```

          * For **Freestyle projects**, add a "Archive the artifacts" post-build action.

      * **GitLab CI/CD (`.gitlab-ci.yml`):**

        ````yaml
        e2e_tests:
          stage: test
          script:
            - npm install
            - npm run cypress:run
          artifacts:
            paths:
              - cypress/reports/mochawesome/ # Archive the entire report directory
            expire_in: 1 week # Optional: define how long artifacts are kept
            # Optional: for GitLab Pages if you want a public URL
            # pages:
            #   script:
            #     - mv cypress/reports/mochawesome/ public/
            #   artifacts:
            #     paths:
            #       - public
            #   only:
            #     - master
            ```

        ````

      * **GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/main.yml`):**

        ```yaml
        # ...
        jobs:
          build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              # ... (other steps: checkout, setup node, install dependencies)
              - name: Run E2E Tests
                run: npm run cypress:run # or your command
              - name: Upload HTML Test Report
                uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 # Use the official upload-artifact action
                if: always() # Important: Upload even if tests fail
                with:
                  name: E2E-HTML-Report # Name for the artifact
                  path: cypress/reports/mochawesome/ # Path to your HTML report directory
                  retention-days: 7 # Optional: how long to keep the artifact
        ```

      * **Azure DevOps (`azure-pipelines.yml`):**

        ```yaml
        - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
          inputs:
            pathToPublish: 'cypress/reports/mochawesome' # Path to your HTML report directory
            artifactName: 'E2E HTML Report' # Name for the artifact
            artifactType: 'Container' # Or 'FilePath'
          displayName: 'Publish HTML Report Artifact'
        ```

      * **CircleCI (`.circleci/config.yml`):**

        ```yaml
        - store_artifacts:
            path: cypress/reports/mochawesome # Path to your HTML report directory
            destination: e2e-html-report # Optional: destination name within artifacts
        ```

#### Step 4: Access and View the HTML Report üåê

Once the HTML reports are archived, you need to know how to access them from your CI/CD platform's UI.

  * **Action:** After a pipeline run, navigate to the specific job/run details page.
  * **Verification:** Look for a section like "Artifacts," "Build Artifacts," or "Job artifacts."
      * Download the archived HTML report bundle.
      * Unzip it (if necessary).
      * Open the main `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`, `mochawesome.html`, `report.html`) in your web browser.

#### Step 5: Run the Pipeline and Verify üìä

Execute your pipeline to ensure everything is set up correctly.

  * **Action:** Trigger a new build/pipeline run.
  * **Verification:**
    1.  Confirm the "Test Execution" step completes successfully.
    2.  Confirm the "Archive/Publish Artifact" step also completes.
    3.  Locate the artifacts section for that specific pipeline run.
    4.  Download the HTML report artifact.
    5.  Open the main HTML file in your browser to confirm the report renders correctly and contains your test results.

-----

By following these steps, you've successfully published your HTML test reports, providing a rich, visual, and interactive way to review your E2E test results directly from your CI/CD pipeline\!

### Managing AWS Credentials in GitLab CI/CD: A Secure and Practical Guide üîí

In any CI/CD pipeline that interacts with Amazon Web Services, securely managing credentials is a top priority. Hardcoding AWS Access Keys and Secret Keys directly into your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is a major security risk, as it exposes your credentials in the repository's history and in pipeline logs.

This guide provides a step-by-step, best-practice approach to managing your AWS credentials in GitLab CI/CD using **masked and protected variables**, ensuring your cloud resources remain secure while enabling seamless pipeline automation.

-----

### The Problem with Hardcoded Credentials üîë

When you hardcode AWS credentials in your pipeline file, you create a number of security vulnerabilities:

  * **Repository Exposure:** Anyone with access to your project's Git history can view your credentials.
  * **Pipeline Log Exposure:** Your credentials can be accidentally printed in pipeline logs, making them visible to anyone with job access.
  * **Lack of Control:** You cannot easily rotate or revoke credentials without changing code and committing the change, which is a slow and risky process.

-----

### The Solution: Secure CI/CD Variables ‚öôÔ∏è

GitLab's CI/CD variables provide a safe and effective solution. By storing your AWS credentials as variables in the GitLab UI, you get the following benefits:

  * **Separation of Concerns:** Your sensitive credentials are no longer stored in your codebase.
  * **Masked & Protected:** You can mask the variables so they are hidden in job logs, and protect them so they are only available on protected branches and tags (e.g., `main`, `release`).
  * **Centralized Management:** Credentials can be easily updated or rotated in one place without touching your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

-----

### Step-by-Step Guide to Secure Credentials

Follow these three steps to set up secure AWS access for your GitLab pipelines.

#### Part 1: AWS IAM Setup

1.  **Create an IAM User:** In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the **IAM service**.
2.  **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:** Create a new IAM User specifically for your GitLab runner. Grant this user only the necessary permissions required by your CI/CD job. For a simple test, you might attach a policy like `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`.
3.  **Generate Credentials:** Create an **Access Key** and **Secret Key** for this new IAM User. **Save these securely**, as they will only be shown once.

#### Part 2: GitLab CI/CD Variables Setup

1.  **Navigate to Variables:** In your GitLab project, go to **`Settings`** -\> **`CI/CD`**.
2.  **Expand Variables:** Find the **`Variables`** section and click **`Expand`**.
3.  **Add Your AWS Credentials:** Create two new variables:
      * **Key:** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
      * **Value:** Paste your Access Key from AWS.
      * **Key:** `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
      * **Value:** Paste your Secret Key from AWS.
4.  **Protect & Mask:** For both variables, make sure to check the **`Protect variable`** and **`Mask variable`** boxes. This is the most critical step for security.

#### Part 3: Pipeline Integration

By default, the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs will automatically look for these environment variables. You don't need to do anything special to your pipeline script, just install the AWS CLI and it will work\!

-----

### Putting it All Together: A Concrete Example üöÄ

This `.gitlab-ci.yml` file demonstrates how a job can securely use the credentials you set up to list your S3 buckets.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - aws-test

# Define a job that runs the AWS CLI

### Advanced Best Practices for Production üí°

  * **Use IAM Roles for CI/CD:** For a more secure, long-term solution, consider using OpenID Connect (OIDC) with GitLab. This allows your CI/CD job to assume a specific IAM Role, providing temporary credentials without you ever having to manage static Access Keys.
  * **Environment-Specific Variables:** For a `staging` pipeline, use a separate IAM user with permissions for the staging environment. For `production`, use a dedicated, more tightly controlled IAM user.
  * **Set Expiration Dates:** When creating credentials, set a reminder to rotate them regularly (e.g., every 90 days).
  * **Monitor and Audit:** Use AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor the API calls made by the IAM user, providing an audit trail of your pipeline's activity.

### Identity & Access Management (IAM) with AWS: Your Security Foundation üîíüîë

In the cloud, security is the top priority. Before you launch a single virtual server or store a byte of data, you must understand how to control who can access your resources and what they are allowed to do. This is the domain of **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.

IAM is the cornerstone of security in AWS. It's a service that enables you to securely manage access to AWS services and resources. Without IAM, all access to your AWS account would be as the `root` user, which has full administrative power‚Äîa highly dangerous practice. IAM is the tool that gives you the ability to apply the **principle of least privilege**, ensuring users and applications have only the permissions they need, and nothing more.

-----

#### The "Why IAM is Your First and Foremost Security Tool"

  * **Enforces the Principle of Least Privilege:** You grant only the permissions required to perform a specific task, minimizing the potential blast radius of a security breach.
  * **Granular Control:** You can define highly specific permissions, down to the level of individual resources and actions (e.g., `s3:GetObject` on a specific file in a specific bucket).
  * **Auditability:** IAM provides logs that track who accessed your resources, when they did it, and from where, giving you a clear security trail.
  * **Separation of Duties:** You can create different roles and permissions for developers, administrators, auditors, and other team members, ensuring no single entity has unchecked power.
  * **Secure Automation:** For applications and services, IAM provides a secure, credentials-free way to interact with other AWS resources, preventing the need to hardcode access keys in your code.

-----

#### Core Components of IAM: The Building Blocks

IAM is built on a few core concepts that work together to define and enforce permissions.

##### 1\. IAM Users üë•

  * A **user** represents a person or an application that needs to interact with AWS.
  * Users are assigned **permanent credentials** (a password for the console and/or an access key/secret key pair for programmatic access).
  * **Best Practice:** Do not share user credentials. Each person or application should have their own unique IAM user.

##### 2\. IAM Groups

  * A **group** is a collection of IAM users.
  * You can attach an IAM policy to a group, and all users in that group will inherit the permissions defined in that policy.
  * **Best Practice:** Use groups to simplify management. Instead of attaching a policy to 20 individual users, attach it once to a group, and simply add or remove users from the group as needed.

##### 3\. IAM Roles üõ°Ô∏è

  * A **role** is an IAM identity that has specific permissions but is not associated with a specific user.
  * Roles are designed to be **assumed** by a trusted entity (an AWS service like EC2 or Lambda, another AWS account, or a federated user).
  * When a role is assumed, it provides **temporary credentials**. This is the most secure way for services to interact with each other, as you don't need to manage or rotate long-lived access keys.
  * **Best Practice:** Always use IAM roles to grant permissions to services like EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or ECS tasks, rather than attaching policies to IAM users with hardcoded credentials.

##### 4\. IAM Policies üìú

  * A **policy** is a JSON document that explicitly defines permissions.
  * Policies are the heart of IAM; they state exactly what actions are allowed or denied on which resources.
  * **Key Policy Elements:**
      * `Effect`: `Allow` or `Deny`
      * `Action`: The specific AWS API actions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `ec2:StartInstances`).
      * `Resource`: The ARN of the resource to which the action applies (e.g., `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*`).
  * **Example: A Simple S3 Read-Only Policy**
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:Get*",
                    "s3:List*"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-company-data-bucket/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

-----

#### Practical IAM Workflow: Securing a Simple Task

Here is a common, secure workflow for a new developer who needs read-only access to a specific S3 bucket:

1.  **Create an IAM User:** Create a new user account named `jane-doe-developer`.
2.  **Create an IAM Group:** Create a group named `s3-readonly-developers`.
3.  **Create a Policy:** Create and save the S3 read-only JSON policy above as a managed policy.
4.  **Attach the Policy:** Attach the new read-only policy to the `s3-readonly-developers` group.
5.  **Add User to Group:** Add the `jane-doe-developer` user to the `s3-readonly-developers` group.

Now, Jane has access keys that can only be used to read objects from `my-company-data-bucket`, and nothing else. This is the **principle of least privilege** in action.

-----

#### Key IAM Best Practices: Your Security Checklist üõ°Ô∏è

  * **Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege:** Start with no permissions and add only what is necessary.
  * **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** **Mandatory** for your root account and highly recommended for all IAM users with elevated privileges.
  * **Use IAM Roles Over IAM Users:** For AWS services, use roles to provide temporary credentials and avoid managing long-lived access keys.
  * **Rotate Credentials Regularly:** For IAM users that require long-lived keys, set a schedule to rotate them.
  * **Don't Share Credentials:** Each user should have their own.
  * **Review Permissions Regularly:** Use the IAM Access Advisor and other tools to audit and trim unnecessary permissions.
  * **Utilize IAM Access Analyzer:** A powerful tool that helps you identify and mitigate unintended access to your resources by external entities.
  * **Lock Down Your Root Account:** Use it only for critical, one-time tasks. Never use it for day-to-day operations.

-----

#### Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model

IAM is your part of the **Shared Responsibility Model**.

  * **AWS is responsible for security *of* the cloud:** This includes the underlying infrastructure, hardware, and global physical security of the data centers.
  * **You are responsible for security *in* the cloud:** This includes managing your IAM identities and permissions, configuring network security, encrypting your data, and protecting your application code.

IAM is the primary tool that empowers you to fulfill your security responsibilities in the AWS Cloud.

### Managing AWS Credentials in GitLab CI/CD: A Secure and Practical Guide üîí

In any CI/CD pipeline that interacts with Amazon Web Services, securely managing credentials is a top priority. Hardcoding AWS Access Keys and Secret Keys directly into your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is a major security risk, as it exposes your credentials in the repository's history and in pipeline logs.

This guide provides a step-by-step, best-practice approach to managing your AWS credentials in GitLab CI/CD using **masked and protected variables**, ensuring your cloud resources remain secure while enabling seamless pipeline automation.

-----

### The Problem with Hardcoded Credentials üîë

When you hardcode AWS credentials in your pipeline file, you create a number of security vulnerabilities:

  * **Repository Exposure:** Anyone with access to your project's Git history can view your credentials.
  * **Pipeline Log Exposure:** Your credentials can be accidentally printed in pipeline logs, making them visible to anyone with job access.
  * **Lack of Control:** You cannot easily rotate or revoke credentials without changing code and committing the change, which is a slow and risky process.

-----

### The Solution: Secure CI/CD Variables ‚öôÔ∏è

GitLab's CI/CD variables provide a safe and effective solution. By storing your AWS credentials as variables in the GitLab UI, you get the following benefits:

  * **Separation of Concerns:** Your sensitive credentials are no longer stored in your codebase.
  * **Masked & Protected:** You can mask the variables so they are hidden in job logs, and protect them so they are only available on protected branches and tags (e.g., `main`, `release`).
  * **Centralized Management:** Credentials can be easily updated or rotated in one place without touching your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

-----

### Step-by-Step Guide to Secure Credentials

Follow these three steps to set up secure AWS access for your GitLab pipelines.

#### Part 1: AWS IAM Setup

1.  **Create an IAM User:** In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the **IAM service**.
2.  **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:** Create a new IAM User specifically for your GitLab runner. Grant this user only the necessary permissions required by your CI/CD job. For a simple test, you might attach a policy like `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`.
3.  **Generate Credentials:** Create an **Access Key** and **Secret Key** for this new IAM User. **Save these securely**, as they will only be shown once.

#### Part 2: GitLab CI/CD Variables Setup

1.  **Navigate to Variables:** In your GitLab project, go to **`Settings`** -\> **`CI/CD`**.
2.  **Expand Variables:** Find the **`Variables`** section and click **`Expand`**.
3.  **Add Your AWS Credentials:** Create two new variables:
      * **Key:** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
      * **Value:** Paste your Access Key from AWS.
      * **Key:** `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
      * **Value:** Paste your Secret Key from AWS.
4.  **Protect & Mask:** For both variables, make sure to check the **`Protect variable`** and **`Mask variable`** boxes. This is the most critical step for security.

#### Part 3: Pipeline Integration

By default, the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs will automatically look for these environment variables. You don't need to do anything special to your pipeline script, just install the AWS CLI and it will work\!

-----

### Putting it All Together: A Concrete Example üöÄ

This `.gitlab-ci.yml` file demonstrates how a job can securely use the credentials you set up to list your S3 buckets.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - aws-test

# Define a job that runs the AWS CLI
list_s3_buckets:
  stage: aws-test
  image: "python:3.9-slim" # We use a Python image as it's easy to install the AWS CLI on
  
  # Ensure this job only runs on protected branches to use the protected variables
  only:
    - main
    
  before_script:
    - echo "Installing AWS CLI..."
    # The --upgrade ensures we get the latest version
    - pip install awscli --upgrade > /dev/null
    - echo "AWS CLI installed successfully."
    
  script:
    - echo "Attempting to list S3 buckets..."
    # The AWS CLI automatically detects the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY variables
    # No need to expose them here.
    - aws s3 ls
    
  after_script:
    - echo "Job finished. The AWS credentials were never exposed in the logs."
```

### Advanced Best Practices for Production üí°

  * **Use IAM Roles for CI/CD:** For a more secure, long-term solution, consider using OpenID Connect (OIDC) with GitLab. This allows your CI/CD job to assume a specific IAM Role, providing temporary credentials without you ever having to manage static Access Keys.
  * **Environment-Specific Variables:** For a `staging` pipeline, use a separate IAM user with permissions for the staging environment. For `production`, use a dedicated, more tightly controlled IAM user.
  * **Set Expiration Dates:** When creating credentials, set a reminder to rotate them regularly (e.g., every 90 days).
  * **Monitor and Audit:** Use AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor the API calls made by the IAM user, providing an audit trail of your pipeline's activity.

### Uploading a File to S3: Your Application's Cloud Storage Destination üíæ

Amazon S3 is a cornerstone of cloud storage, providing a durable, scalable, and secure place to store everything from application artifacts to user-generated content. Uploading files to S3 is a fundamental operation in many DevOps workflows, enabling tasks like static website deployment, data backup, and content delivery.

This guide will walk you through the process of uploading a file to an S3 bucket, starting with the manual command-line method and then showing you how to automate it in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

-----

### Why Upload to S3?

  * **Cloud Hosting:** S3 is the go-to service for hosting static web assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and other application content.
  * **Data Backup & Archiving:** It offers a highly durable and cost-effective solution for backing up critical data.
  * **Artifact Storage:** CI/CD pipelines can upload build artifacts, test reports, and deployment packages to S3 for long-term storage and easy retrieval.
  * **Scalability:** S3 scales to store any amount of data, so you don't have to worry about running out of space.

-----

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

  * **An AWS Account:** With an S3 bucket created for your project.
  * **AWS Credentials:** An IAM user with the necessary permissions (e.g., `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`) to interact with your S3 bucket.
  * **AWS CLI Installed & Configured:** The AWS Command Line Interface should be installed and configured on your machine.

-----

### Step-by-Step Guide: Using the AWS CLI

The `aws s3 cp` and `aws s3 sync` commands are the primary tools for uploading files to S3 from your terminal.

#### 1\. Uploading a Single File

Use the `aws s3 cp` command to copy a file from your local machine to a specific location in an S3 bucket.

```bash
aws s3 cp <local-file-path> s3://<your-bucket-name>/<destination-folder>/
# Example:
aws s3 cp index.html s3://learn-gitlab-app-bucket/static-content/
```

#### 2\. Uploading and Syncing a Directory

For uploading an entire directory (e.g., a static website's `build/` folder), the `aws s3 sync` command is more efficient. It intelligently compares the source and destination and only uploads new or modified files.

```bash
# Sync your local directory to the S3 bucket
aws s3 sync <local-directory-path> s3://<your-bucket-name>/<destination-folder>/
# Example:
aws s3 sync ./build s3://learn-gitlab-app-bucket/
```

To ensure the S3 bucket is a perfect mirror of your local directory, you can add the `--delete` flag. This will remove files from S3 that no longer exist locally.

```bash
aws s3 sync ./build s3://learn-gitlab-app-bucket/ --delete
```

-----

### Automating the Upload in GitLab CI/CD üöÄ

The real power of uploading to S3 comes from automating the process in your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures every deployment is consistent and repeatable.

The key is to use a Docker image with the AWS CLI installed and to securely provide your AWS credentials via GitLab's protected variables.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - build
  - deploy_to_s3

# Assume a previous job in the 'build' stage created a 'build/' directory artifact

deploy_to_s3:
  stage: deploy_to_s3
  # Use a Python image, as installing the AWS CLI is straightforward
  image: python:3.9-slim
  
  # The job needs the artifacts from the build stage
  needs:
    - job: build_job
      artifacts: true

  before_script:
    - echo "--- Installing AWS CLI ---"
    - pip install awscli --upgrade > /dev/null
    - echo "AWS CLI installed successfully."
    - echo "--- Checking for AWS Credentials ---"
    # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are provided by GitLab CI/CD variables
    - |
      if [ -z "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" ] || [ -z "$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: AWS credentials are not set as CI/CD variables. Exiting."
        exit 1
      fi

  script:
    - echo "--- Deploying build artifacts to S3 ---"
    # The AWS CLI automatically uses the environment variables for credentials
    # The CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA creates a unique folder for each commit
    - aws s3 sync ./build s3://learn-gitlab-app-bucket/$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA/
    - echo "Deployment complete. Files are available at s3://learn-gitlab-app-bucket/$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA/"
```

**Key Elements in the CI/CD Script:**

  * **`image: python:3.9-slim`**: A lightweight image that allows us to easily install the AWS CLI using `pip`.
  * **`pip install awscli`**: Installs the AWS CLI inside the job container.
  * **`$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` & `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`**: These are not defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`. They are securely stored in your project's **GitLab CI/CD variables** and automatically injected into the job's environment.
  * **`aws s3 sync`**: This command performs the upload. We use `$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA` to create a unique folder for each pipeline run, ensuring we have a complete history of deployments.

-----

### Best Practices for S3 Uploads

  * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure your IAM user for CI/CD has only the `s3:PutObject` and other minimal permissions required for the upload.
  * **Use `aws s3 sync` for Deployments:** It's more efficient than `aws s3 cp` for syncing entire directories, as it only transfers changed files.
  * **Automate Everything:** Integrate your S3 uploads into a CI/CD pipeline to ensure every build is consistently deployed.
  * **Use Versioning:** S3 bucket versioning is a great way to protect against accidental overwrites or deletions.
  * **Leverage S3 Bucket Policies:** To secure your S3 bucket, use bucket policies to restrict public access and define fine-grained permissions.

### Hosting a Website on S3: A Simple, Scalable, and Cost-Effective Solution üåê

Amazon S3 isn't just for data storage; it's also a powerful and popular platform for hosting **static websites**. S3 static website hosting is a simple, highly scalable, and cost-effective way to serve content composed of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other client-side assets. It eliminates the need for managing web servers and their infrastructure, allowing you to focus on your website's content.

-----

### Why Use S3 for Static Hosting?

  * **Cost-Effective:** You only pay for the storage you use and the data you transfer out. For low-traffic sites, this can be extremely inexpensive.
  * **Highly Scalable:** S3 is designed for massive scale, so your website can handle sudden spikes in traffic without any performance degradation or manual intervention.
  * **Reliable & Durable:** Your website's files are stored with S3's renowned 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability.
  * **Secure:** You can secure your website with HTTPS using AWS CloudFront and control access with S3 bucket policies.
  * **No Server Management:** There are no operating systems, patches, or server instances to manage. You just upload your files, and S3 handles the rest.

-----

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

  * **An AWS Account:** A configured AWS account with an S3 bucket created.
  * **Static Website Content:** Your website's files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`).

-----

### Step-by-Step Guide: Configuring Your S3 Bucket

The process of enabling static website hosting is done via the AWS Management Console.

1.  **Navigate to S3:** Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.

2.  **Select Your Bucket:** Click on the name of the S3 bucket you want to use for your website.

3.  **Go to Properties:** In the bucket's detail page, click on the **"Properties"** tab.

4.  **Enable Static Website Hosting:** Scroll down to the **"Static website hosting"** section and click **"Edit"**.

      * Select **"Enable"** for static website hosting.
      * **Index document:** Enter the name of your main landing page file (e.g., `index.html`).
      * **Error document (Optional):** Enter the name of your custom error page file (e.g., `error.html`).
      * Click **"Save changes"**.

5.  **Copy the Endpoint URL:** After saving, S3 will provide an **Endpoint URL** for your website (e.g., `http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). This is the public URL for your website.

6.  **Set Public Access (Crucial):** By default, S3 buckets are private. To allow public access to your website's content, you need to configure a **Bucket Policy**.

      * Go to the **"Permissions"** tab of your bucket.
      * In the **"Block public access (bucket settings)"** section, click **"Edit"** and uncheck the box for **"Block all public access"**. Confirm the changes.
      * Under the **"Bucket policy"** section, click **"Edit"** and add the following JSON policy. Replace `your-bucket-name` with the actual name of your bucket.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

      * This policy allows anyone on the internet (`"Principal": "*"`) to perform the `s3:GetObject` action on all objects (`"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"`) in your bucket, effectively making them publicly readable.

-----

### Uploading Your Content üìÅ

Once your bucket is configured, you can upload your static website's files using the AWS CLI. Navigate to the root directory of your website's files and run:

```bash
# Upload and synchronize your local directory to the S3 bucket
aws s3 sync . s3://your-bucket-name/
```

  * The `sync` command is efficient as it only uploads new or changed files.

-----

### Automating Hosting with GitLab CI/CD üöÄ

This is where S3 hosting shines. You can automate the entire build and deployment process with a single CI/CD job.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - build
  - deploy_to_s3

# Assumes a previous job in the 'build' stage created a 'build/' directory artifact

deploy_to_s3:
  stage: deploy_to_s3
  image: python:3.9-slim
  
  # The job needs the artifacts from the build stage, which contains our website files
  needs:
    - job: build_job
      artifacts: true

  before_script:
    - echo "--- Installing AWS CLI ---"
    - pip install awscli > /dev/null
    
  script:
    - echo "--- Deploying static website to S3 ---"
    # Ensure AWS credentials are set as protected variables in GitLab
    - aws s3 sync ./build s3://learn-gitlab-app-bucket/ --delete
    - echo "Deployment complete. Your website is available at the S3 endpoint URL."
```

-----

### What's Next: Adding Performance and a Custom Domain

For a production-grade website, you should:

  * **Use AWS CloudFront:** Integrate an AWS CloudFront distribution  to serve your content from a globally distributed Content Delivery Network (CDN), significantly improving performance and adding HTTPS support.
  * **Point a Custom Domain:** Configure your domain's DNS to point to the CloudFront distribution, so users can access your site at `www.your-domain.com`.

By leveraging S3 static website hosting, you get a powerful, low-maintenance solution for your web content, perfectly integrated into a modern CI/CD workflow.
