#### Core Concepts: The ABCs of S3

Understanding these fundamental components is key to working with S3:

* **Buckets:**
    * A bucket is a fundamental container for data in S3. It's like a top-level folder in cloud storage.
    * Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts.
    * You create buckets in a specific AWS Region.
* **Objects:**
    * An object is the fundamental entity stored in an S3 bucket.
    * An object consists of the **data** (your file) and **metadata** (a set of name-value pairs that describe the object, like content type, last modified date, and custom data).
    * Objects are identified by a unique **key** within a bucket (e.g., `my-folder/my-file.txt`).
    * Individual objects can range from 0 bytes up to 5 TB (larger files can be uploaded using multipart upload).
* **Keys:**
    * The unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Essentially, the full path to the object within that bucket.
