### Section 8: Advanced GitLab CI - Pushing the Boundaries of Your Pipeline üöÄ

Welcome to Section 8 of our journey! Having mastered the fundamentals of GitLab CI/CD, this section will elevate your skills to the next level. We'll move beyond basic builds and tests to explore advanced features and best practices that make your pipelines more efficient, secure, and maintainable.

This section focuses on the techniques used by professional DevOps teams to build scalable, flexible, and powerful CI/CD workflows.

***

### Why Advanced CI/CD Matters

A basic pipeline is great, but a mature pipeline is a strategic asset. Advanced CI/CD techniques enable you to:

* **Optimize Performance:** Reduce build times and lower costs by running jobs only when necessary and reusing results.
* **Enhance Security:** Proactively scan for vulnerabilities in both your code and your dependencies.
* **Increase Flexibility:** Build a pipeline that can adapt to different application types and deployment environments with a single, reusable configuration.
* **Improve Maintainability:** Keep your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file clean, dry, and easy to understand as your project grows.
* **Automate More:** Extend the reach of your pipeline beyond just building and deploying, into tasks like dynamic security testing and code analysis.

***

### Section Overview: What You'll Learn

In this section, we will dive into the following advanced topics:

* **Advanced Job Rules:** Go beyond simple `only/except` statements to use complex, conditional logic with `rules` to control when jobs run.
* **CI/CD Templates and Includes:** Learn how to create reusable job templates and share them across projects, making your pipeline configurations DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
* **Dynamic Pipeline Generation:** Master the use of keywords like `extends` and `include` to build modular, maintainable, and flexible pipelines.
* **Docker Multi-Stage Builds:** Learn how to create smaller, more secure Docker images by separating your build environment from your production runtime.
* **Pipeline for Monorepos:** Discover how to configure a pipeline that intelligently runs jobs only for the parts of a monorepo that have changed.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate automated security scans (SAST, DAST, Dependency Scanning) to find and fix security issues early in the development cycle.
* **Auto DevOps:** Explore how GitLab's powerful Auto DevOps feature can automatically detect, build, test, and deploy your applications with zero configuration.

***

### Learning Outcomes: By the End of This Section, You Will Be Able To...

* Write highly efficient and conditional `.gitlab-ci.yml` files using advanced `rules`.
* Create reusable CI/CD templates that can be shared across multiple projects.
* Build optimized, multi-stage Docker images for production.
* Implement a smarter, more targeted pipeline for monorepos.
* Proactively find security vulnerabilities in your applications using GitLab's built-in scanning tools.
* Understand the full potential of GitLab CI/CD as an end-to-end DevOps platform.

### Retrying Failed Jobs Automatically: The `retry` Keyword üîÑ

In a CI/CD pipeline, some jobs may fail intermittently due to temporary network issues, race conditions, or other transient problems. These are often called **flaky failures**. Manually restarting a job every time this happens is a waste of time and a source of frustration. GitLab's `retry` keyword provides a simple, yet powerful solution to this problem by automatically re-running failed jobs.

-----

### How the `retry` Keyword Works

The `retry` keyword is defined at the job level. It accepts an integer value that specifies the number of times GitLab should automatically retry the job before marking it as a final failure.

  * `retry: <number>`: Retries a job up to `<number>` times. For example, `retry: 2` means GitLab will try the job a total of three times (the initial run plus two retries).
  * By default, `retry` is set to `0` (no retries). The maximum value you can set is `2`.

-----

### The Problem of Flaky Tests

A common use case for `retry` is with E2E (end-to-end) tests. These tests can sometimes fail due to temporary network latency or a UI element not loading in time. A simple retry can often resolve these issues, allowing the pipeline to proceed without human intervention. This prevents your pipeline from being unnecessarily blocked by transient failures.

-----

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1\. Add the `retry` Keyword to a Job

You add the `retry` keyword directly to the job you want to automatically retry.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - test
  - deploy

# A job that runs E2E tests, which can sometimes be flaky
e2e_tests:
  stage: test
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/node:lts-slim
  
  script:
    - echo "Running E2E tests..."
    # The command to run your tests
    - npx playwright test

  # The `retry` keyword is added here
  retry: 2

# A deployment job that depends on the tests
deploy_to_staging:
  stage: deploy
  # This job will only run if the 'e2e_tests' job succeeds (after all retries)
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to staging..."
```

#### 2\. Observe the Pipeline Behavior

When you run this pipeline, if the `e2e_tests` job fails on its first attempt, GitLab will:

1.  Automatically restart the job.
2.  If the job succeeds on the retry, the pipeline will continue as normal.
3.  If the job fails on its second attempt, GitLab will automatically restart it for a final time.
4.  If the job fails on the third attempt, it will be marked as a final failure, and the pipeline will stop.

In the pipeline view, retried jobs are clearly marked with a retry count, so you can easily identify them. This provides valuable insights into which jobs are flaky and might need to be improved.

-----

### What's Next?

While the `retry` keyword is a quick and effective solution for dealing with flaky jobs, it should not be a long-term fix for poorly written code or unstable tests. A best practice is to use `retry` as a temporary solution while you investigate and fix the root cause of the intermittent failures. It should be seen as a safety net, not a replacement for reliable code.

### Allowing Failures: The `allow_failure` Keyword ‚öôÔ∏è

In a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, not all job failures are critical. Some jobs, like code quality reports or performance checks, are intended to provide information and warnings rather than act as a strict gate for the pipeline. The `allow_failure` keyword provides a way to mark a job as non-critical. If a job with `allow_failure: true` fails, the pipeline will continue to run, but the job will be marked with a yellow warning icon.

-----

### Why Use `allow_failure`?

  * **Non-Critical Feedback:** It allows you to integrate jobs that provide valuable feedback (like a security scan or linter report) without blocking the entire pipeline.
  * **Pipeline Efficiency:** Your pipeline can continue running, and you can review the failures of non-critical jobs later.
  * **Flexibility:** It gives you granular control over which jobs are strict gates and which are for informational purposes.

-----

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1\. Add the `allow_failure` Keyword to a Job

You add the `allow_failure` keyword directly to the job you want to allow to fail.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - review

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building app..."

e2e_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running E2E tests..."
    - exit 1 # This job will fail

# This job is for code quality reports and is allowed to fail
code_quality_check:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running code quality check..."
    - exit 1 # This job will fail
  allow_failure: true

deploy_review_app:
  stage: review
  script:
    - echo "Deploying review app..."
```

In this example, even though `code_quality_check` fails, the `e2e_tests` and `deploy_review_app` jobs will still run.

-----

### What's Next?

The `allow_failure` keyword is often used in conjunction with other features like `rules` and `when`. For example, you might have a job that only runs for a merge request and is allowed to fail, but the same job is a strict gate when it runs on the main branch. This provides a balance between giving fast feedback and ensuring quality in your main branch.

### YAML Anchors and Aliases: Streamlining Your `.gitlab-ci.yml` ‚öì

As your GitLab CI/CD pipeline grows, your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file can become long and repetitive, particularly when many jobs share identical configurations (like the `before_script`, `image`, or `rules`). **YAML Anchors (`&`) and Aliases (`*`)** provide a powerful mechanism to reuse blocks of configuration, making your pipeline definition significantly cleaner, more concise, and easier to maintain.

Using anchors and aliases is a core best practice for building mature and scalable CI/CD pipelines.

-----

### 1\. The Core Concept: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

YAML anchors and aliases allow you to define a configuration block once (the anchor) and reference it many times (the alias). This prevents repetition, meaning you only have to update a configuration in one place, and all jobs referencing it are instantly updated.

| Symbol | Name | Purpose | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **`&`** | **Anchor** | **Defines** the reusable block of configuration. | `&test_setup` |
| **`*`** | **Alias** | **References** the anchored block, copying its content. | `*test_setup` |
| **`<<:`** | **Merge Key** | **Merges** the referenced block into the current mapping. | `<<: *test_setup` |

-----

### 2\. Step-by-Step Implementation

The most common and effective way to use anchors and aliases in GitLab CI/CD is to define reusable blocks at the **top-level** of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, often prefixed with a dot (`.`) so they are treated as abstract configurations and are not executed as jobs themselves.

#### Example: Reusing the `before_script` and `image`

Let's simplify a pipeline where both `unit_tests` and `integration_tests` use the same setup.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - test
  - deploy

# 1. Define the reusable block (the ANCHOR)
.default_test_setup: &common_test_config
  image: node:18-alpine
  before_script:
    - npm install --silent
    - echo "Dependencies installed."
  tags:
    - docker

# -------------------------------------------------------------

unit_tests:
  stage: test
  # 2. Reference and merge the anchor (the ALIAS and MERGE KEY)
  <<: *common_test_config
  script:
    - npm run test:unit
  # This job now automatically includes the image and before_script from the anchor.

integration_tests:
  stage: test
  <<: *common_test_config
  script:
    - npm run test:integration
  # This job also includes the common setup.
```

-----

### 3\. Advanced Use: Overriding and Extending

The beauty of the YAML merge key (`<<:`) is that it intelligently merges configuration, allowing you to easily override specific keys from the anchored block.

#### Example: Overriding a Key

In the example below, the `deploy_production` job uses the shared `docker_setup` but overrides the `rules` to require a manual action.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

# Define the common Docker setup
.default_docker_build_config: &docker_build_config
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - docker:dind
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
      when: on_success # Default: Automated deployment

# -------------------------------------------------------------

deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  <<: *docker_build_config # Merge all common Docker setup
  script:
    - echo "Deploying automatically to staging..."

deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  <<: *docker_build_config # Merge the common Docker setup
  rules: # OVERRIDE the rules defined in the anchor
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
      when: manual # Change from automated to manual
  script:
    - echo "Deployment requires manual approval..."
```

**Key Result:** The `deploy_production` job inherits the `image` and `services` but uses its local, customized `rules` block. The merge key (`<<:`) always prioritizes keys defined *locally* over those referenced in the anchor.

-----

### 4\. Best Practices for Anchors and Aliases

  * **Use Abstract Names:** Prefix reusable blocks with a dot (`.`) (e.g., `.common_settings`) to prevent GitLab from recognizing them as runnable jobs.
  * **Define Anchors at the Top:** Place all your anchor definitions at the beginning of your file for easy readability and maintenance.
  * **Keep Anchors Focused:** Create anchors that are small and focused on one specific area (e.g., `.docker_service_setup`, `.test_dependencies`). This makes them easier to combine and manage.
  * **Combine Anchors:** You can combine multiple anchors within a single job to build complex configurations from smaller, reusable parts. This significantly improves pipeline maintainability and reduces file size.

By implementing YAML anchors and aliases, you transform a sprawling configuration file into a clean, modular, and professional CI/CD pipeline definition.

-----

### Job Templates with YAML Anchors and Aliases: A Practical Example ‚öì

YAML Anchors (`&`) and Aliases (`*`) are powerful tools for creating reusable configuration blocks, effectively turning them into job templates. This is a core practice for achieving **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, making your pipeline highly maintainable and readable.

This guide provides a practical example of creating and consuming a base test template to define multiple testing jobs quickly.

-----

### The Goal: Creating Reusable Job Templates

We want three testing jobs (`unit_tests`, `lint_check`, `e2e_tests`) that share the following common configuration:

1.  Use the same **base Docker image**.
2.  Run the same **dependency installation** steps.
3.  Are restricted to only run on the `main` branch or a **Merge Request pipeline**.

By using a YAML anchor, we define this common configuration only once.

-----

### Step 1: Define the Base Template (The Anchor)

Create an abstract configuration block at the top of your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. We name it with a leading dot (`.`) so GitLab does not recognize it as a runnable job.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - test
  - security
  - deploy

# 1. THE ANCHOR: Define the reusable template block
.base_test_template: &test_definition
  # Configuration shared by all jobs:
  image: node:20-alpine
  before_script:
    - npm install --silent
    - echo "Dependencies ready."
  # Rules shared by all jobs: restrict to main branch or MR pipelines
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
      when: on_success
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
      when: on_success
```

  * **`&test_definition`**: This is the **Anchor** name. It marks this entire block as reusable.

-----

### Step 2: Consume the Template (The Alias and Merge Key)

Now, we define our specific jobs and use the **Merge Key** (`<<:`) to pull in the configuration from the anchor. We only need to define the specific `stage` and the unique `script` for each job.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml (Continued)

# --- Consuming the Template ---

unit_tests:
  stage: test
  <<: *test_definition # ALIAS: Merge all config from the 'test_definition' anchor
  script:
    - npm run test:unit # Unique command for this job
  # This job inherits image, before_script, and rules.

lint_check:
  stage: test
  <<: *test_definition # ALIAS: Merge all config from the 'test_definition' anchor
  script:
    - npm run lint # Unique command for this job
  allow_failure: true # Local OVERRIDE: This job is non-critical

e2e_tests:
  stage: test
  <<: *test_definition # ALIAS: Merge all config from the 'test_definition' anchor
  script:
    - npm run start &
    - sleep 10 # Wait for app to start
    - npx playwright test # Unique command for this job
  timeout: 15 minutes # Local ADDITION: Add a specific timeout for E2E tests

# -------------------------------------------------------------
```

-----

### Practical Advantages Demonstrated

1.  **Readability:** The definition of each job is now very concise, focusing only on its unique purpose (`script`).
2.  **Maintenance:** If you decide to change the base image from `node:20-alpine` to `node:22-alpine`, you only need to update the image tag in **one place** (`.base_test_template`). All three jobs automatically inherit the change.
3.  **Flexibility (Overriding):** The `lint_check` job demonstrates how to easily **override** or **add** local settings. It inherits all the common setup but locally sets `allow_failure: true`, showing how templates provide a strong baseline while still permitting customization.

This approach ensures that your GitLab CI configuration is modular, easy to scale, and professional.

-----

### Reusing Configuration with `extends`: Building Modular Pipelines with Inheritance üß±

The **`extends`** keyword is a modern and explicit way in GitLab CI/CD to reuse configuration, offering a cleaner alternative or complement to YAML Anchors and Aliases. It enables you to create a **base job template** and then have other jobs **inherit** its configuration, simplifying your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file through clear inheritance.

This approach is crucial for building scalable, highly maintainable, and modular pipelines.

-----

### How `extends` Works: The Inheritance Model

The `extends` keyword allows a job to inherit the entire configuration of one or more specified abstract jobs (templates). It operates on a principle of inheritance:

1.  **Child Job:** The job using `extends` (the child).
2.  **Parent Job (Template):** The abstract job being extended (the parent).
3.  **Merge Logic:** The child job's local configuration overrides the configuration inherited from the parent. If a key is present in both, the child's value wins.

This is often considered cleaner than YAML anchors/aliases because it's more explicit about which template a job is built from.

-----

### Step-by-Step Implementation

The best practice is to define abstract configuration jobs using a leading dot (`.`), so they are not executed as part of the pipeline.

#### Example: Defining and Extending a Base Test Job

Let's refactor the previous testing template using `extends`.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - test
  - deploy

# 1. Define the Abstract Parent Job (The Template)
.base_test_definition:
  image: node:20-alpine
  before_script:
    - npm install --silent
    - echo "Dependencies ready."
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
      when: on_success
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
      when: on_success

# -------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. The Child Job: Inherit and Customize

unit_tests:
  stage: test
  extends: .base_test_definition # Inherits image, before_script, and rules
  script:
    - npm run test:unit # Unique command for this job

lint_check:
  stage: test
  extends: .base_test_definition # Inherits base configuration
  script:
    - npm run lint
  allow_failure: true # Local Override/Addition: Adds a non-critical setting

e2e_tests:
  stage: test
  extends: .base_test_definition
  script:
    - npm run start &
    - sleep 10
    - npx playwright test
  timeout: 15 minutes # Local Addition: Adds a specific timeout
```

-----

### Advantages of `extends` over YAML Anchors

While anchors and `extends` achieve similar results, `extends` offers key benefits:

| Feature | `extends` Keyword | YAML Anchors/Aliases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clarity** | Explicitly defines inheritance, showing the template name right in the job. | Requires referencing the less intuitive `&` and `*` symbols. |
| **Simplicity** | Cleaner syntax; no need for the `<<:` merge key. | Requires the merge key (`<<:`) to combine configurations, which can be verbose. |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | **Easily supports multiple inheritance** (e.g., `extends: [.template_a, .template_b]`), merging configurations from several sources. | Merging multiple anchors is possible but becomes visually complex and cluttered. |
| **Override Priority** | Follows clear inheritance rules: child's keys always override parent's keys. | Follows standard YAML merge rules, which can sometimes lead to less intuitive behavior for beginners. |

For building highly structured and complex pipelines, **`extends` is often the preferred method** because it promotes better readability and organization through explicit inheritance.

----

### Importing YAML Configuration from Other Files: The `include` Keyword üß©

As your application and its CI/CD pipeline grow, placing all job definitions, templates, and complex configurations into a single `.gitlab-ci.yml` file becomes unwieldy. The **`include`** keyword is a fundamental feature of advanced GitLab CI/CD, allowing you to **split your configuration into multiple, smaller YAML files** and import them into your main pipeline definition.

This practice is essential for maintainability, modularity, and achieving a professional, scalable pipeline structure.

-----

### Why Use the `include` Keyword?

  * **Modularity and Readability:** Breaks down a massive, sprawling configuration file into smaller, logically grouped components (e.g., separate files for testing, deployment, and security). This makes the pipeline easier to read, navigate, and debug.
  * **Reusability Across Projects:** Allows you to define generic templates (like a standardized security scan job or a common build script) in a separate file and reuse that file across multiple projects, fostering consistency throughout your organization.
  * **Maintainability (DRY Principle):** Simplifies updates. For example, if you update the definition of your static website deployment in one template file, every project that includes that file is updated automatically.
  * **Dynamic Pipelines:** Enables advanced, conditional pipeline generation (covered in later sections) where the pipeline structure itself changes based on what files were modified or which branch is being used.

-----

### Methods for Including Configuration

The `include` keyword supports several ways to pull configuration into your main `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

#### 1\. Local Files (Preferred for Project Structure)

Includes configuration files located in the same GitLab project.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

include:
  # Imports the file located at '.gitlab-ci/build.yml' in the current repository
  - local: '.gitlab-ci/build.yml'
  
  # Imports the file located at '.gitlab-ci/test-templates.yml'
  - local: '.gitlab-ci/test-templates.yml'
  
stages:
  - build
  - test
  # The imported files will define jobs that fit into these stages
```

  * **Use Case:** Structuring a single project (e.g., breaking down a monolith's pipeline).

#### 2\. Files from Other Projects (Reusability)

Includes configuration files from another private or public GitLab repository.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

include:
  # Imports the file named 'security-scan.yml' from the 'gitlab-templates/ci-templates' project
  - project: 'shared-templates/ci-templates'
    file: 'security-scan.yml'
    ref: 'v1.0.0' # Best practice: lock to a specific tag or SHA for stability
```

  * **Use Case:** Sharing standardized CI templates across multiple teams or departments.

#### 3\. Remote Files (External Sources)

Includes configuration files hosted at a public URL (e.g., raw file links).

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

include:
  # Imports a file via HTTPS (useful for public or globally hosted configurations)
  - remote: 'https://gitlab.com/awesome-ci/ci-utils/-/raw/main/deployment.yml'
```

  * **Use Case:** Importing public, general-purpose configurations. (Use `project` or `local` where possible for better security and version control.)

#### 4\. GitLab Templates (Pre-defined)

Includes official GitLab templates (e.g., Docker, Pages, or specific language templates).

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

include:
  # Imports the built-in template for Docker build
  - template: Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml
```

  * **Use Case:** Leveraging GitLab's extensive library of officially maintained CI/CD templates.

-----

### Practical Example: Modularizing the Pipeline

Here's how a pipeline for the `learn-gitlab-app` might be split using `include`:

| File | Purpose | Key Jobs/Templates Defined |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`.gitlab-ci.yml`** (Main) | Defines the stages and imports all necessary files. | `stages: [build, test, deploy]` |
| **`.gitlab-ci/build.yml`** | Defines the image build process. | `build_and_push_docker_image` |
| **`.gitlab-ci/test.yml`** | Defines all testing jobs. | `unit_tests`, `e2e_tests` |
| **`.gitlab-ci/templates.yml`** | Defines reusable templates. | `.base_test_config` (using YAML anchors/extends) |

**The result in the main file:**

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml (The main file)

include:
  - local: '.gitlab-ci/templates.yml' # First, load reusable templates
  - local: '.gitlab-ci/build.yml'     # Second, load build jobs
  - local: '.gitlab-ci/test.yml'      # Third, load test jobs

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
```

This structure keeps the main file clean, acting primarily as a table of contents and orchestrator, while the complexity is managed in its corresponding, modular files.

-----

### CI/CD Components & Catalog: Building Reusable, Shared Pipeline Logic üß©

The **CI/CD Components** feature in GitLab represents the ultimate level of pipeline modularity and reusability. Moving beyond simple `include` and `extends`, Components allow teams to package complex, shareable pipeline logic (like a standardized deployment process or a certified security scan) into a single, version-controlled unit that can be easily discovered, integrated, and maintained across an entire organization.

The **CI/CD Catalog** is the public-facing hub where these reusable components are listed, documented, and made accessible to project maintainers.

-----

### Why Components are the Future of CI/CD

  * **Enforced Standards:** Security, Compliance, and DevOps teams can create certified Components for critical tasks (e.g., "Deploy to Production," "Vulnerability Scan"), ensuring every project uses the same approved logic.
  * **Simplified Integration:** Developers don't need to understand complex YAML structure; they simply reference a single Component and pass configuration via input parameters.
  * **Discoverability:** The Catalog provides a searchable interface, making it easy for developers to find pre-built solutions rather than writing or copying boilerplate code.
  * **Version Control:** Components are versioned, allowing teams to quickly upgrade to the latest features or securely roll back to a previous working version.
  * **Maintainability (DRY at Scale):** A bug or an improvement in a Component is fixed once, and the fix is immediately available to every consuming project.

-----

### Core Concepts

#### 1\. CI/CD Component

A Component is a standalone project containing a single, primary YAML file (`template.yml` or the file matching the component's name) and a structured `README.md` for documentation.

  * **Definition:** A Component's content is the reusable configuration. It typically uses the `spec` keyword to define input parameters that the consuming pipeline must provide.
  * **Input Parameters:** Defined using the `inputs` section within the Component's YAML, these allow the Component to be configured without modifying its internal logic.
      * *Example Input:* Passing the Docker image tag or the target environment name.

#### 2\. CI/CD Catalog

The Catalog is the UI within a GitLab instance where all certified and available Components are listed and documented.

  * **Visibility:** Components must be published to the Catalog to be easily discoverable by other projects.
  * **Metadata:** The Catalog displays the Component's name, description, documentation, and version history.

-----

### Implementation: From Template to Component Usage

The key difference between using a simple `include` and a Component is the way the configuration is referenced and parameterized.

#### 1\. Defining the Component (The Source Project)

The Component repository contains the reusable logic.

```yaml
# my-deploy-component/templates/deploy.yml

# Define required inputs for this component
spec:
  inputs:
    - stage:
        default: deploy
        description: "The pipeline stage to run the deployment job in."
    - image-tag:
        description: "The specific Docker image tag to deploy."

---
# The actual job definition uses the input parameters
deploy-app-job:
  stage: $[[ inputs.stage ]] # Use the input for the stage name
  image: alpine/git:latest
  script:
    - echo "Deploying image: $[[ inputs.image-tag ]]" # Use the input for the image tag
    - deploy-script --image $[[ inputs.image-tag ]]
```

#### 2\. Using the Component (The Consuming Project)

In the consuming project, the configuration is minimal and clean.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml (Consuming Project)

include:
  # Reference the Component using its full path and version (tag)
  - component: my-group/my-deploy-component@1.0.0 
    # Pass the required input values
    inputs:
      stage: production-deploy
      image-tag: $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA # Pass a dynamic CI variable

stages:
  - production-deploy # Ensure the stages are defined
```

-----

### Comparison: Component vs. Template (`include`)

| Feature | CI/CD Component | Simple `include` (Template) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discoverability** | High (Listed in the searchable CI/CD Catalog) | Low (Must know the exact path and file name) |
| **Input Management** | **Structured and required parameters (`inputs`)** | Achieved via global CI variables (less secure/explicit) |
| **Usability** | Simple to use; acts like a "function call" in your YAML | Requires knowledge of YAML anchors/extends to customize |
| **Maintenance** | Single source of truth, easily versioned via Git tags | Can lead to version drift if not managed carefully |

-----

By adopting CI/CD Components, your organization moves toward a mature model of **GitLab as a Platform**, where shared standards are enforced, and complex automation is made accessible and reliable for every development team.

  * **Enforced Standards:** Security, Compliance, and DevOps teams can create certified Components for critical tasks (e.g., "Deploy to Production," "Vulnerability Scan"), ensuring every project uses the same approved logic.
  * **Simplified Integration:** Developers don't need to understand complex YAML structure; they simply reference a single Component and pass configuration via input parameters.
  * **Discoverability:** The Catalog provides a searchable interface, making it easy for developers to find pre-built solutions rather than writing or copying boilerplate code.
  * **Version Control:** Components are versioned, allowing teams to quickly upgrade to the latest features or securely roll back to a previous working version.
  * **Maintainability (DRY at Scale):** A bug or an improvement in a Component is fixed once, and the fix is immediately available to every consuming project.

-----

### Core Concepts

#### 1\. CI/CD Component

A Component is a standalone project containing a single, primary YAML file (`template.yml` or the file matching the component's name) and a structured `README.md` for documentation.

  * **Definition:** A Component's content is the reusable configuration. It typically uses the `spec` keyword to define input parameters that the consuming pipeline must provide.
  * **Input Parameters:** Defined using the `inputs` section within the Component's YAML, these allow the Component to be configured without modifying its internal logic.
      * *Example Input:* Passing the Docker image tag or the target environment name.

#### 2\. CI/CD Catalog

The Catalog is the UI within a GitLab instance where all certified and available Components are listed and documented.

  * **Visibility:** Components must be published to the Catalog to be easily discoverable by other projects.
  * **Metadata:** The Catalog displays the Component's name, description, documentation, and version history.

-----

### Implementation: From Template to Component Usage

The key difference between using a simple `include` and a Component is the way the configuration is referenced and parameterized.

#### 1\. Defining the Component (The Source Project)

The Component repository contains the reusable logic.

```yaml
# my-deploy-component/templates/deploy.yml

# Define required inputs for this component
spec:
  inputs:
    - stage:
        default: deploy
        description: "The pipeline stage to run the deployment job in."
    - image-tag:
        description: "The specific Docker image tag to deploy."

---
# The actual job definition uses the input parameters
deploy-app-job:
  stage: $[[ inputs.stage ]] # Use the input for the stage name
  image: alpine/git:latest
  script:
    - echo "Deploying image: $[[ inputs.image-tag ]]" # Use the input for the image tag
    - deploy-script --image $[[ inputs.image-tag ]]
```

#### 2\. Using the Component (The Consuming Project)

In the consuming project, the configuration is minimal and clean.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml (Consuming Project)

include:
  # Reference the Component using its full path and version (tag)
  - component: my-group/my-deploy-component@1.0.0 
    # Pass the required input values
    inputs:
      stage: production-deploy
      image-tag: $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA # Pass a dynamic CI variable

stages:
  - production-deploy # Ensure the stages are defined
```

-----

### Comparison: Component vs. Template (`include`)

| Feature | CI/CD Component | Simple `include` (Template) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discoverability** | High (Listed in the searchable CI/CD Catalog) | Low (Must know the exact path and file name) |
| **Input Management** | **Structured and required parameters (`inputs`)** | Achieved via global CI variables (less secure/explicit) |
| **Usability** | Simple to use; acts like a "function call" in your YAML | Requires knowledge of YAML anchors/extends to customize |
| **Maintenance** | Single source of truth, easily versioned via Git tags | Can lead to version drift if not managed carefully |

-----

By adopting CI/CD Components, your organization moves toward a mature model of **GitLab as a Platform**, where shared standards are enforced, and complex automation is made accessible and reliable for every development team.

-----

### Writing Multi-line Scripts: Simplifying Complex Logic in GitLab CI/CD üìù

When your pipeline jobs need to execute a sequence of commands, managing them on separate lines under the `script` keyword can quickly become cluttered. **YAML's multi-line scalar syntax** provides a clean, readable, and efficient way to define complex, multi-step shell scripts directly within your `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

This is a fundamental skill for keeping your pipeline logic organized and easy to debug.

-----

### The Problem: Single-Line Commands

If you define complex logic using a list of single `script` commands, you lose the benefits of standard shell scripting, like shared variables and conditional logic:

```yaml
# Inefficient and hard to read
script:
  - TEMP_TAG="staging-${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}" # TEMP_TAG is lost after this line
  - docker build -t $TEMP_TAG .
  - docker push $TEMP_TAG
  - if [ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" == "main" ]; then deploy_prod; fi # Logic becomes verbose
```

In the example above, each `-` entry runs in a separate shell instance, meaning any variables set (like `TEMP_TAG`) are lost immediately.

-----

### The Solution: YAML Block Scalars

YAML offers two primary block scalars for multi-line content: the **literal block scalar (`|`)** and the **folded block scalar (`>`)**. For shell scripting in GitLab CI, the **literal block scalar (`|`)** is the preferred and most reliable method.

#### 1\. The Literal Block Scalar (`|`)

The vertical bar (`|`) tells the parser to preserve **all newlines and internal indentation** exactly as they appear.

  * **Result:** The entire block of text is passed to a **single shell instance** (e.g., `bash`), allowing you to use standard shell features like `if/then/else` and retain variable scope across the entire block.
  * **Best Practice:** This is the standard way to write complex scripts in GitLab CI.

<!-- end list -->

```yaml
deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  image: docker:latest
  script:
    # Use the literal block scalar (|) to wrap the entire script
    - |
      # 1. Start the script with 'set -e' for safety
      set -e
      
      echo "--- Starting Complex Deployment Script ---"
      
      # 2. Variable scope is now maintained across lines
      APP_VERSION="v1.0.${CI_PIPELINE_IID}"
      DOCKER_IMAGE="$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$APP_VERSION"

      # 3. Use standard shell logic (if/then/else)
      if [ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" == "main" ]; then
        echo "Building production image: $DOCKER_IMAGE"
        docker build -t "$DOCKER_IMAGE" .
        docker push "$DOCKER_IMAGE"
        deploy_to_prod "$DOCKER_IMAGE"
      else
        echo "Skipping production deployment on branch $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH."
      fi
      
      echo "--- Script Finished Successfully ---"
```

#### 2\. The Folded Block Scalar (`>`)

The greater-than sign (`>`) tells the parser to fold (replace) newlines with spaces, treating the entire block as a single, long line of text.

  * **Result:** While it saves horizontal space, it's **rarely used for shell scripting** because it can easily break commands that rely on specific formatting or line breaks.

-----

### Best Practices for Multi-line Scripts

  * **Use `|` Consistently:** Adopt the literal block scalar (`|`) as your standard for any job requiring more than two commands.
  * **Start with `set -e`:** Always begin your multi-line script with `set -e`. This is a vital best practice in shell scripting that forces the script to **exit immediately if any command fails** (returns a non-zero exit code). This prevents the pipeline from continuing with a potentially corrupted or incomplete state.
  * **Maintain Indentation:** The indentation level of the script content relative to the `|` marker is preserved. Use consistent two-space or four-space indentation for readability.
  * **Use Comments:** Treat the multi-line block as a proper script and include comments (`#`) to explain complex logic or steps.
  * **Abstract Complex Logic:** If the script grows beyond 20-30 lines, consider moving the logic out of `.gitlab-ci.yml` and into a separate shell script file (e.g., `deploy.sh`). You can then simply call this script from your CI job: `script: - ./deploy.sh`.

By leveraging the multi-line literal block scalar (`|`), you gain the full power of your shell environment, making your CI/CD scripts robust, clear, and easy to maintain.

### Starting a Server / Background Process within a Job ‚öôÔ∏è

In a CI/CD pipeline, many jobs require a server or service to be running in the background before the main task can execute. This is most common for **End-to-End (E2E) testing** and **integration testing**, where the test runner needs a live application instance to connect to. Running a background process correctly and ensuring the job waits for it to be ready are critical steps for building reliable and non-flaky pipelines.

The core challenge is managing the server process's execution and lifecycle within the single-shell environment of the CI job.

-----

### The Core Technique: Running in the Background (`&`)

To run a server in the background, you append an ampersand (`&`) to the execution command. This immediately returns control to the terminal (the script), allowing subsequent commands to run.

1.  **Start the Process:** Append `&` to the startup command.
2.  **Capture the PID:** Immediately capture the **Process ID (PID)** using the special shell variable `$!`. This is essential for controlling or stopping the process later.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# Example 1: Start a Node.js server
npm run start &
SERVER_PID=$!

# Example 2: Start an API on a specific port
python3 api.py --port 8080 &
API_PID=$!
```

-----

### The Critical Step: Waiting for Readiness (Health Check)

The biggest mistake is immediately running the test after starting the server. The test runner will likely fail because the server hasn't finished initializing. A simple `sleep 10` is brittle and inefficient. The robust solution is to use a **health check loop**.

This loop repeatedly checks a known health endpoint until it receives a successful response, guaranteeing the service is ready.

#### Robust Health Check Loop

This pattern is highly recommended:

```bash
# Example: Waiting for the app to be available on port 3000
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000/health"
MAX_ATTEMPTS=30
WAIT_SECONDS=1

echo "Waiting for app to become healthy at $APP_URL..."

# Loop to retry the health check
for i in $(seq 1 $MAX_ATTEMPTS); do
  # Use curl with the --fail flag: exits with 0 only on success (HTTP 2xx or 3xx)
  if curl --fail -s $APP_URL; then
    echo "Application is ready on attempt $i."
    break
  fi
  echo "Application not yet ready, waiting $WAIT_SECONDS second(s)... ($i/$MAX_ATTEMPTS)"
  sleep $WAIT_SECONDS
done

# Final check: If the loop finished without the 'break', the app failed to start.
curl --fail -s $APP_URL || { echo "ERROR: Application failed to start within the timeout!"; exit 1; }
```

This ensures the script pauses for the minimum necessary time and provides a clear failure mechanism if the server never comes up.

-----

### Comprehensive CI/CD Script Example

Combining all these elements creates a reliable E2E test job. The entire logic is wrapped in a multi-line script (`|`) for clean variable scoping.

```yaml
e2e_tests:
  stage: e2e
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/node:lts-slim # Image with test tools
  script:
    - | # Use the literal block scalar to manage the entire script lifecycle
      set -e
      
      echo "--- 1. Starting Application Server ---"
      npm run start:server &
      SERVER_PID=$! # Capture the PID for cleanup

      echo "--- 2. Waiting for Health Check ---"
      # Robust health check loop goes here (as defined above)
      APP_URL="http://localhost:3000/health"
      for i in $(seq 1 30); do
        if curl --fail -s $APP_URL; then break; fi
        sleep 1
      done
      curl --fail -s $APP_URL || { echo "ERROR: App failed to start!"; kill $SERVER_PID; exit 1; }

      echo "--- 3. Running E2E Tests ---"
      npx playwright test

      echo "--- 4. Cleaning Up Background Process ---"
      kill $SERVER_PID || true # Gracefully kill the background process
      wait $SERVER_PID || true # Ensure the shell waits for cleanup before exiting
```

-----

### Best Practices for Background Processes

  * **Always Capture PID:** Use `PID=$!` immediately after running the process to control its lifecycle.
  * **Always Clean Up:** Use `kill $PID` and `wait $PID` in the cleanup phase to prevent resource leaks and ensure a clean job exit. The `|| true` prevents the job from failing if the process unexpectedly exited already.
  * **Use `set -e`:** Start your multi-line script with `set -e` so the job fails immediately if any command, including the health check, returns an error.
  * **Access Inside the Container:** Background processes should be accessed via `localhost` and the internal container port, not the external host's port.

### GitLab Pages: Hosting Static Websites Directly from Your Repository üåê

**GitLab Pages** is a powerful feature that allows you to publish static websites directly from any project within GitLab. It's a free service provided by GitLab that automatically builds and deploys your static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, static site generator output) using your existing GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

GitLab Pages is the perfect solution for hosting documentation, personal blogs, open-source project sites, or any simple static application.

-----

### How GitLab Pages Works

The process of deploying a website via GitLab Pages is entirely integrated with and driven by your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

1.  **Job Definition:** You define a specific job named `pages` in your CI/CD pipeline.
2.  **Artifact Generation:** This job is responsible for compiling your static site (if applicable) and moving all resulting files into a directory named **`public/`**.
3.  **Artifact Upload:** The `pages` job archives the contents of the `public/` directory and uploads it as an artifact.
4.  **Automatic Serving:** Once the job succeeds, GitLab automatically detects the `pages` artifact, extracts the files from the `public/` directory, and serves them publicly via a dedicated URL.

-----

### Key Requirements for a Pages Job

For GitLab to successfully recognize and deploy your static site, the `pages` job must meet three mandatory criteria:

1.  **Job Name:** The job *must* be named **`pages`**.
2.  **Artifact Path:** The job *must* specify the artifact path as the directory **`public/`**.
3.  **Artifact Expiry:** The artifact must not have an `expire_in` time set, or it should be long enough to keep the site active.

#### Example: Deploying a Simple HTML Site

If your project already contains your static files, the job is minimal:

```yaml
pages:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  script:
    # 1. Ensure the directory is named 'public'
    - mkdir .public
    - cp -r * .public/ # Copy all project files into the new directory
    - mv .public public # Rename the directory to 'public'
    - echo "Pages deployment structure created."
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public # 2. The artifact path MUST be 'public'
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH # Only deploy from the default branch (e.g., 'main')
```

#### Example: Deploying a Site Built with a Static Site Generator (SSG)

If your site requires compilation (e.g., using Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby), the job must first run the build process and then move the output to the `public/` folder.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

pages:
  stage: deploy
  image: node:20-alpine # Use an image with Node.js to run the build script
  
  script:
    - echo "Installing dependencies and building site..."
    - npm install
    # Run the static site generator's build command (e.g., 'npm run build' generates files into a 'dist' folder)
    - npm run build 
    
    # The critical step: move the compiled output (e.g., 'dist') into the 'public/' directory
    - mv dist public 
    - echo "Site deployed to public/ directory."
    
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public # Artifact path must be 'public'
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH # Only deploy when merging to the main branch
```

-----

### Accessing Your GitLab Pages Site

Once the `pages` job successfully completes, your website will be accessible at a URL based on your project's path:

  * **For Project Websites:** `http://<username>.gitlab.io/<project-path>`
  * **For User/Group Websites:** `http://<username>.gitlab.io` (Requires the project to be named exactly `<username>.gitlab.io` or `<groupname>.gitlab.io`).

You can find the direct link to your deployed site under your project's **`Deploy > Pages`** settings.

-----

### Best Practices for GitLab Pages

  * **Use Specific Rules:** Always use `rules` to restrict the `pages` job to only run on the main branch (`$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH`) or on tags. Deploying on every branch push is inefficient.
  * **Optimize Build Time:** Use lightweight Docker images (like Alpine variants) and leverage CI/CD caching for dependencies to speed up the build process.
  * **Use `.nojekyll`:** If you are *not* using Jekyll and GitLab mistakenly tries to process your content as Jekyll, place an empty file named `.nojekyll` in the root of your `public/` directory.
  * **Custom Domains & HTTPS:** GitLab Pages supports custom domains and automatic generation of SSL/TLS certificates (HTTPS), which should be configured for any production-ready site.
